## Introduction

Crime patterns within urban environments are shaped by a complex interplay of socioeconomic, demographic, and spatial factors. This analysis focuses on the city of Los Angeles, examining how median household income, neighborhood boundaries, and racial demographics relate to variations in crime frequency. By integrating data from local law enforcement reports, U.S. Census surveys, and geospatial neighborhood shapefiles, we aim to uncover meaningful relationships that go beyond simplistic assumptions and stereotypes.

Graph explanation: The color from dark to bright means median income from low to high.

The graph shows that there is no clear relationship between median income and total crimes based on the data points presented. While there is a general trend of lower median incomes associated with higher total crimes, there are several outliers that do not fit this pattern. Some areas with relatively high median incomes also have high total crime rates, and vice versa. This suggests that factors beyond just income level likely play a significant role in determining crime rates within a community. Simply assuming that higher-income neighborhoods will have lower crime rates oversimplifies the complex social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute to public safety. A more nuanced analysis would be needed to fully understand the relationship between these variables across different geographic areas.
Our team decide to investigate the frequent of property crime by the each neighborhood that sort by their median income.

## Violent crime in each neighborhood order by their income

    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )

```
Graph explanation: The x-axis(areas) are order in ascending median income order, which we will expected from left to right neighborhood, the count of property crime will increase. 


The chart reveals a notable outlier: the Central neighborhood, which reports a disproportionately high number of violent crimes relative to its median income. While the general trend aligns with the assumption—often rooted in societal stereotypes—that lower-income neighborhoods experience higher levels of violent crime, Central deviates from this expectation. Despite not having the lowest median income, its violent crime rate far exceeds those of other neighborhoods. This suggests that relying solely on income as a predictor of crime may oversimplify a more complex issue. Factors such as geographic location, population density, proximity to transit hubs, or the concentration of commercial and nightlife activities might better explain the elevated crime rate in Central. This highlights the importance of challenging stereotypes and exploring a broader range of influences when analyzing crime patterns.

## Crime-to-Population Ratio per Area

```{r Ratio Graph}
#| echo: false

# Filter for 2024 data, remove NA values, and calculate crime-to-population ratio
crime_population_2024 <- crime_population_summary %>%
  filter(year == 2024) %>%
  mutate(crime_to_population_ratio = ifelse(total_population > 0, crime_count / total_population, NA)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(crime_to_population_ratio) & !is.na(`AREA NAME`))  # Remove rows with NA in crime ratio or area name

# Plot the crime-to-population ratio per area for 2024
ggplot(crime_population_2024, aes(x = reorder(`AREA NAME`, crime_to_population_ratio), y = crime_to_population_ratio)) +

    title = "Crime-to-Population Ratio per Area (2024)",
    x = "Neighborhood",
    y = "Crime-to-Population Ratio"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8))  # Adjust text size for readability

```
This graph illustrates the crime-to-population ratio for various neighborhoods in Los Angeles for the year 2024, highlighting how certain areas experience disproportionately high levels of crime relative to their population size. Neighborhoods like 77th Street, Southwest, and Southeast top the list, with crime-to-population ratios well above 0.2, suggesting that their residents may face a higher per capita exposure to crime.

Previously, our analysis noted that Central, despite not having the lowest median income, still exhibited a notably high number of crimes. This new visualization broadens that insight, confirming that elevated crime rates are not confined to just one outlier. While Central still appears high on this chart, it is now evident that other neighborhoods—such as 77th Street and Southwest—exceed these levels, indicating that income alone does not fully explain crime density.

These patterns challenge the simplistic assumption that higher-income neighborhoods automatically experience lower crime rates. Instead, the data underscores the importance of considering a range of factors. Geographic location, local commercial activity, transit hubs, population density, and other environmental or social variables may all play pivotal roles in shaping these crime-to-population ratios. This complexity supports our earlier conclusions that a nuanced, multifaceted approach is necessary to understand and address the distribution of crime across urban landscapes.

      summarize(total_crimes = n()),
    by = "name"               # Join by neighborhood name or another matching column
  )

  )


```
This heatmap visualizes the spatial distribution of total crimes across neighborhoods under the LAPD jurisdiction, with higher crime rates indicated by brighter yellow hues and lower crime rates shown in darker purple. The outlier observed in the previous bar chart, Central, is corroborated here as one of the brightest regions on the map, indicating a notably high concentration of crimes.

When connecting this to the previous graph, we see that Central's geographic location likely plays a significant role in its elevated crime levels. The neighborhood's centrality and potential proximity to high-density areas, transit hubs, or commercial districts could contribute to the high crime numbers. This geographic clustering of crime challenges the stereotype that violent crime is solely tied to lower-income areas, as Central's median income is not the lowest yet its crime rate is disproportionately high. It suggests that spatial dynamics, such as the presence of key urban features and high activity zones, may compound the crime rate independent of income alone.



# What Motivated Our Data Analysis:
Crime is a pervasive issue that affects communities differently based on various socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic factors. Understanding what drives crime frequency is crucial for developing effective policies and interventions to promote equity and public safety.

Our data analysis was motivated by the desire to uncover relationships between crime and the following key factors:

**Economic Status** (e.g., median income) \
**Demographics** (e.g., racial composition) \
**Location** (e.g., neighborhood characteristics) \
\



# Variables of Interest

The primary variables we analyzed included:

**Crime Frequency:** The total number of reported crimes in a neighborhood. \
**Economic Data:** Median household income from the American Community Survey (ACS). \
**Neighborhood Boundaries:** Spatial boundaries defined by the LA Times. \
**Location Data:** Geospatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) for reported crime incidents. \
#Add to here as necessary \
To explore these variables, we integrated datasets from LAPD crime reports, U.S. Census economic data, and geospatial shapefiles for Los Angeles neighborhoods. This allowed us to analyze both spatial and statistical relationships. \
#Add links here

# Key Questions
**Economic Status and Crime:** Does a neighborhood's median income influence the number of crimes reported? \
**Geographic Crime Hotspots:** Are there specific areas with persistently high crime rates? \
**Disparities in Crime Impact:** How do demographic or socioeconomic disparities correlate with crime?
#Add here as necessary \

# Modeling and Inference
## Motivation for the Model
We aim to understand the relationship between median income and crime, considering racial demographics as a moderating factor. This requires modeling total crimes as a function of average median income and racial groupings. To account for overdispersion in crime count data, we employ both Poisson regression and Negative Binomial regression frameworks.

## Model Selection
**Why Poisson and Negative Binomial Models?**

Crime counts are discrete and non-negative, making Poisson regression an intuitive starting point. \
Overdispersion (variance exceeding the mean) was evident, prompting the use of a Negative Binomial regression model.
Predictors Considered

**Median income**: Hypothesized to influence crime rates inversely. \
**Race**: Used as categorical predictors to examine demographic disparities in crime incidence. \
**Interaction terms**: Incorporated to explore how income effects vary across racial groups. \

## Modeling Steps

### Poisson regression model:
```{r Poisson}
#| echo: False 
#| results: "hide"
poisson_model <- glm(crime_count ~ avg_median_income + race, family = poisson(link = "log"), data = crime_race_long)
summary(poisson_model)
```

**Key Insights:**
Average median income is negatively associated with crime counts and is statistically significant in this analysis.
To interpret the effect of average median income on crime count, we need to exponentiate the coefficient:
e
−
0.0019821
≈
0.9980196
e 
−0.0019821
 ≈0.9980196
This means that for each dollar increase in average median income, the expected crime count is multiplied by approximately 0.9980196. To express this as a percentage decrease:
1
−
0.9980196
≈
0.0019804
1−0.9980196≈0.0019804
Therefore, for each dollar increase in average median income, the expected crime count decreases by about 0.19804%, assuming other variables constant.

In terms of race, there were several that were statistically significant, meaning that they had a p-value less than 0.05. The races (Black, Hispanic/Latin/Mexican, Unknown, White) showed significant positive associations with crime count. We have to see if these trends carry over to the negative binomial model. 
### Negative Binomial regression model:
```{r Neg. Binomial}
#| echo: False 
#| results: "hide"
nb_model <- glm.nb(crime_count ~ avg_median_income * race, data = crime_race_long)
summary(nb_model)
```

**Key Insights:**

Unlike the poisson distribution, the negative binomial's median income was not as statistically significant with a p-value of 0.79 which is much higher than the poisson's p-value of 7.42e-15. In practical terms, this means that after accounting for overdispersion in the negative binomial model, there is no strong evidence of a relationship between average median income and crime count in this dataset, however it may be small.\

Based on the negative binomial regression results, the coefficient for avg_median_income is -0.0016531. This means that for each dollar increase in average median income, the expected log count of crimes decreases by 0.0016531, holding other variables constant.
To interpret this in terms of the actual crime count, we can exponentiate the coefficient:
e
−
0.0016531
≈
0.9983472
e 
−0.0016531
 ≈0.9983472
This indicates that for each dollar increase in average median income, the expected crime count is multiplied by approximately 0.9983472. In other words, there is a decrease of about 0.17% (1 - 0.9983472 = 0.0016528) in the expected crime count for every dollar increase in average median income. 

From the several races with correlation from the Poisson graph, the two races that remain significant are Hispanic/Latin/Mexican and Black. As the LAPD only take victim descriptions, there could be larger, more broad implications at play that warrant further research. 

These associations do not imply causation and may reflect complex socioeconomic factors not fully captured in the model.
The marginally significant result for the Black category suggests a trend, but there's less certainty about this relationship compared to the Hispanic/Latin/Mexican category.
Other factors not included in the model could be influencing these relationships.
These findings should be considered in the broader context of potential reporting biases, policing practices, and socioeconomic conditions in different neighborhoods.

### Why Negative Binomial Was Better
**Dispersion Issue:** The Poisson model assumes that the mean and variance of the dependent variable (crime counts) are equal. However, the data exhibits overdispersion (variance > mean), as indicated by the high residual deviance in the Poisson model. \
**Model Fit:** The Negative Binomial regression explicitly accounts for overdispersion with a dispersion parameter (Theta = 9.252), leading to improved model fit (lower AIC: 19758 vs. 20106 and reduced deviance). \
**Interpretation:** While both models identify significant predictors (e.g., raceHispanic.Latin.Mexican), the Negative Binomial model provides more reliable estimates due to its ability to handle overdispersed data.


## Predicted Trends
Using the model, we predict crime counts across income ranges for each racial group:
```{r Predicted Trends}
#| echo: false

grid <- expand.grid(
  avg_median_income = seq(
    length.out = 100
  ),
  race = unique(crime_race_long$race)
)
grid$predicted_crimes <- predict(nb_model, newdata = grid, type = "response")

```

This figure illustrates how income impacts predicted crime counts, highlighting disparities among racial groups.\

We can see that there are some outliers to the general trend that as median income goes up, crime counts goes down. White, chinese, and Filipinos are the outliers and this could be from more broad implications. It could mean that on average whites, Filipinos and Chinese live in wealthier neighborhoods so that crimes may go up due to population differences in income. We would have to do further analysis using something like census data to see if this is true. 


### Uncertainty and Limitations
**1. Uncertainty in Estimates:**

- Wide confidence intervals for certain racial group coefficients suggest variability in observed patterns.\
- Limited data for smaller racial groups (e.g., Laotian, Cambodian) may result in unreliable estimates.\

**2.Model Assumptions:**

- Both Poisson and Negative Binomial models assume log-linear relationships, which may oversimplify real-world dynamics.\
- Spatial dependencies (e.g., crime clustering in neighborhoods) are not accounted for, potentially biasing results.\

**3. Data Limitations:**

- The dataset has missing values for some predictors, leading to excluded observations.\
- Aggregation by neighborhood may obscure within-neighborhood variability in income and crime rates.\

### Future Directions

- Integrate additional predictors like unemployment rates, educational attainment, or policing density to refine insights.\
- Perform robustness checks by using alternative categorizations for racial groups or income brackets.\
